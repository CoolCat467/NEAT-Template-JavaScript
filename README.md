# NEAT Template Python3
Original version in JavaScript programmed by Code-Bullet at https://github.com/Code-Bullet/NEAT-Template-JavaScript.
Re-programmed by CoolCat467 in Python3 and using Pygame based of Code-Bullet's Javascript.

At the moment, this is not complete, so I am not posting it yet.


If Code-Bullet ever sees this, your youtube videos are great other than sometimes bad language.
